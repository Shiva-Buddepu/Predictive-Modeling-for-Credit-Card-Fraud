##  Project Workflow

### **1. Load Required Packages**
Imported essential libraries for data handling, visualization, and modeling 

---

##  2. Read & Inspect the Data
Performed initial checks to understand the dataset

---

##  3. Data Exploration
Explored and visualized
Handled class imbalance during training using


---

##  4. Predictive Modeling
Implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning models:

### **Models Used**
- **RandomForestClassifier**  
- **AdaBoostClassifier**  
- **CatBoostClassifier**  
- **XGBoostClassifier**

### **Evaluation Metrics**
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- ROC–AUC  

The focus was on **maximizing recall** due to high cost of fraud miss-detection.
